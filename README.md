# Enhanced-KNN-for-Network-Attack-Detection
Overview

This repository contains the implementation and results for an Enhanced KNN classification method tailored for detecting network attacks like DDoS and PortScan in cloud computing environments. The model leverages feature mean modeling and IQR-based interval analysis to optimize computational efficiency, memory usage, and prediction time.
Directory Structure

    src/:
        Contains the Python scripts for running experiments on DDoS and PortScan datasets and the core model implementation (model.py).
    data/:
        Includes instructions for downloading the CICIDS 2017 dataset and storing the required files.
    results/:
        Contains graphs, CSV files, and text summaries of experimental results for both attack types.
    README.md:
        This guide for understanding the project setup and usage.
